# MilkDrop-MusicVisualizer
MilkDrop is a music visualizer - a "plug-in" to the Winamp music player. As you listen your music in Winamp, MilkDrop takes you flying through the actual soundwaves you're hearing, and uses beat detection to trigger myriad psychedelic effects, creating a rich visual journey through sound. MilkDrop can also be driven by a live audio feed (microphone or line-in) - see the documentation for details.
